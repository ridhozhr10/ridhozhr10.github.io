Hi, my name is Ridho Azhar.

You can call me Ridho, Ido, Do, or simply Bre/Bro—whatever works for you.

I’m a versatile software engineer who focuses on web development. I’m passionate about informatics and love creating seamless user experiences. I believe in effective communication to deliver my work.

Honesty and simplicity are my guiding principles. I tackle problems with a commitment to quick and efficient solutions, whether they require an adaptive or technical approach

## A little history

As a kid, my mom bought me a lot of toys, but the one that always grabbed my attention was a puzzle board. I found it super fun to finish each new puzzle. There was even a time I ignored a friend who came over because I had a new puzzle to solve.

Growing up in the 2000s, when tech and the internet were booming, I got really into information technology and spent a lot of my time in internet cafes. I used to mess around with games and tried out scripting, mainly to cheat in games.

I found it really rewarding to create or use software to make things easier. I think developing software is like working on a big puzzle—figuring out each piece until you get the result you want.

## My Journey to Professional

Since finishing vocational high school in 2016, I've been immersed in the world of web development. It didn't take long for me to get hooked—I love the thrill of creating dynamic user experiences and diving into new tech.

After getting the hang of front-end work, I decided to tackle the backend. It was a bit of a wild ride at first, but I soon got the hang of building robust services that can handle anything you throw at them.

And let's not forget about infrastructure stuff such as container orchestration and virtualization. Working with things like Kubernetes has always been exciting for me.

I'm all about lifelong learning. Whether it's mastering the latest web tools, tinkering with new programming languages, or geeking out over AI trends, I'm constantly expanding my skill set.

Nowadays, I thrive on the challenges each project brings. Every day is a chance to learn something new and push the boundaries of what's possible in software engineering.

## TL;DR

In summary, my journey has been all about solving puzzles—whether it's developing a sleek front-end, building a robust backend, or orchestrating everything with containers. I'm always excited to take on new challenges and learn from each experience.
