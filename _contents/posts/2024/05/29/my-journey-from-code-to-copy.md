## Contents

# Background

Recently, I've been busy building this siteâ€”my very own portfolio to showcase my web development prowess. I'm confident with the technical stuff; CSS, JavaScript, you name it, I can handle it. But here's the kicker: "How do I create content for my website?"

You can be a wizard with all the coding in the world, but if your site lacks content, what are you really showing off? It's like having a beautifully crafted car with no fuel.

Just like many other young adults, I decided to tackle this head-on by asking someone (or something) with a vast vocabulary for help. And who knows more words than ChatGPT? This AI is trained with more words than all the books I've ever readâ€”combined. To top it off, I can chat with it just like a real person.

To be honest, I don't rely heavily on AI tools during my development process. I'm accustomed to manually searching for information on Googleâ€”although, nowadays, even that can feel a bit outdated, don't you think? ðŸ˜†.

So, here's my adventure in copywriting, powered by the magic of AI. Buckle up and let's dive in!

## Like drawing, start with sketch

Writing is an artistic craft; you can't just ask AI to create things for you and copy-paste it. Sure, you could, but you'd lose a lot of important elements like your personality, tone, and what idea you want to bring. Even for AI, plagiarism is a big no-no. So, how do I do it, you may ask? Ah, thank you for asking! ðŸ˜†

```
Just like drawing, start with a sketch
```

Think of it like sketching a rough draft. Begin by writing one to three paragraphs that capture your tone, personality, and main idea. Then, ask ChatGPT for feedback by prompting questions like, "How does this paragraph sound?" or "Can you rate my writing?" This initial step may feel incomplete, but AI can fill in the gaps and refine your content.

## Prompt the AI with a simple request

You've got the AI fired up with your idea and your personality. Now, it's time to witness the magic unfold. Prompt the AI with a simple request:

> "Generate me a finished article from this."

And voila! Within seconds, the AI churns out a piece that feels like a finished product, complete with more vocabulary than you could possibly imagine.

It's like witnessing the birth of artâ€”a moment where creativity meets technology in harmony. But let's not be fooled; while the AI may provide a baseline, the work is not truly finished.

## You don't take everything

As a writer, your work doesn't stop at writing. You also need to review what you've written. When the AI generates a lot of content, it can be overwhelming. Instead of copying everything, take your time to go through it. Choose the parts that match the style and message of your article.

> Keep what works, discard what doesn't.

In essence, what I'm trying to convey is: please, take the time to review and refine. Don't be lazy.

## Finishing up: every art need an audience

Lastly, what you need is a feedback. Think of ChatGPT as your writing buddy. Just ask it for feedback and read what it says. It's like chatting with a friend who gives you helpful advice. By using ChatGPT this way, you can make your writing better and understand what your readers might think. Listen to the feedback and improve your work

# TL;DR

Creating a website is like building a big structure. But without interesting content, it's like an empty building.

Beginning my writing journey with the assistance of AI technology has truly been eye-opening. It has shown me that writing isn't just about putting words downâ€”it's about infusing them with personality and purpose.

Using AI tools like ChatGPT has been incredibly helpful for me in every step of the writing process. Sorting through its suggestions has taught me to pick out the best ones and discard the rest.

Using it helps me write articles that connect with my audience. Feedback, whether from people or AI, helps me learn more. After all, isn't using technology always a way to make things easier?
