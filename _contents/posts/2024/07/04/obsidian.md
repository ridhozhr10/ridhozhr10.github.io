# Introduction

First things first, I just want to share some exciting news with you. I landed a new jobâ€”yay! With my background as a coder, you might guess I got a position as a software engineer or maybe a senior coder.

Nope! This time, I've stepped into a new role as a "Cloud Engineer.". It's a bit outside my comfort zone, but, uh, hey, it's still tech-related... right?

My first week as a cloud engineer was a total beatdown. âœ¨
```

There were so many new terms, names, jargon and concepts that, to be honest, left me feeling pretty confusedâ€”and I'm the type of guy that get lost easily.

Aaaaand, during this struggling time, like any other so-called productive guy.

```text
I procrastinated a bit. ðŸ™ƒ
```

Time for some YouTube videos, I thought. And lo and behold, the algorithm blessed me with an interesting video recommendation.

So, in this article, I just want to tell you guys how I use [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) and how this software has helped me big time.

## Obsidian.md Basic

Obsidian calls the storage a **Vault**. A **Vault** is just a folder in your local file system where all your notes are kept.

![Obsidian.md](/img/posts/obsidian1.png){style="max-width:400px;margin:5px auto;"}

After creating a **Vault**, you will be welcomed with a basic template that looks something like this:

![Obsidian first vault created](/img/posts/obsidian2.png){style="margin:5px auto;"}

### Now, How to start using it ?

To answer that, I need to tell you my side of the story since i will be using my use-case as an example. Okay, here it comes:

- I have some personal projects, like this website, that I need to maintain. Drafting an article, development backlog, things i want to try, etc.
- with this new job in a different role that I'm not used to, I need to keep learning while keeping up on ongoing projects and daily tasks at work.
- My current company require me to get some certification, I need to keep track of which certifications I need to take and all the study material required to complete them.
- I'm also planning to enroll in university, since i do not have any formal degree yet.
- You know that moment when you're just zoning out, and out of nowhere, a cool idea pops up? If only I could keep it somewhere and not forget it in three minutes. Yeah, i need to somewhere to place it too.

Here is current graph of my obsidian vault:
