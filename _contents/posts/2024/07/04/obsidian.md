# Introduction

First things first, I just want to share some exciting news with you all. I landed a new jobâ€”yay! With my background as a coder, you might guess I got a position as a software engineer or maybe a senior coder.

Nope! This time, I've stepped into a new role as a "Cloud Engineer.". It's a bit outside my comfort zone, but, uh, hey, it's still tech-related... right?

My first week as a cloud engineer was a total beatdown. âœ¨
```

There were so many new terms, names, jargon and concepts that, to be honest, left me feeling pretty confusedâ€”and I'm the type of guy that get lost easily.

During this struggling time, like any other so-called productive guy.

```text
I procrastinated a bit. ðŸ™ƒ
```

Time for some YouTube videos, I thought. And lo and behold, the algorithm blessed me with an interesting video recommendation.
