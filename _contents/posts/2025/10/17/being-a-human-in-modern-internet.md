# First of all

The first post i write in this site is this one [Tackling the Content Conundrum: My Journey from Code to Copywriting](https://ridhozhr10.github.io/posts/2024/05/29/my-journey-from-code-to-copy) and i kinda apoligize for that. To summarize it for you since you are im, all i say was how hard it is for me to write some content and solving it with the power of muh AI ‚ú®.

So, maybe you may ask (or not, i do care but still, you do you)

> What happen lil bro ? why the apoligies? you good, slurping your own saliva like that ?

Well, let me explain üòî

# AI Slop

On some random off day, like anyone else, i just chilling around and scrolling youtube. And i stumble on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zfN9wnPvU0).

_"AI Slop"_, where AI generated content is flooding in media with information. Doesn't matter the source are true or not, as long as it was "catchy enough".

I hate to see the current state of social media, ruined by a lot of misinformation or just plain HOAX. and this make me think

> Wait, i was doing the same. i use AI to write my content, and i encourage it with my post

And for that reason, i write this post.

# I STOP USING AI

just kidding, i still using AI. But now, i treat it as a "TOOL" like it should be. i will not write blog using AI.

sure, it will be suck, but it is all me, my word and my thought.

After all, i don't have to prove nothing in here, this site is just a personal site anyway. "letting people to know me better", is the reason i create this site in the first place.

That's it thanks for reading üòÅ
